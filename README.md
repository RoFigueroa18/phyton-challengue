HW for DataBootCamp Module 3

PyBank

This Python script imports the necessary libraries (csv and os) and defines a function (analyze_financial_records) to analyze financial records from a CSV file. The script reads a CSV file containing financial data, calculates various financial metrics, and prints the results to the console. It also writes the results to a text file named "financial_results.txt."

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

Import Libraries:
    import csv: Imports the CSV module for handling CSV files.
    import os: Imports the OS module for interacting with the operating system.

Define File Path:
    file_path: Constructs the absolute file path to the CSV file using the os.path.join function.

Define Analysis Function:
    analyze_financial_records(csvdata): This function takes a CSV file path as an argument and performs the following tasks:

Initializes variables to store financial metrics.
    Reads the CSV file, skipping the header row.
    Iterates through each row in the CSV, extracting date and profit/loss values.
    Calculates total months, net total, and profit/loss changes.
    Calculates the average change, greatest increase, and greatest decrease.
    Prints the results to the console.
    Calls another function (write_results_to_file) to save the results to a text file.

Write Results to File Function:
    write_results_to_file(file_name, total_months, net_total, average_change, greatest_increase_date, greatest_increase, greatest_decrease_date, greatest_decrease): This function takes the file name and financial metrics as arguments and writes the results to a text file.

Call Analysis Function:
    analyze_financial_records(file_path): Calls the analyze_financial_records function with the provided CSV file path to analyze the financial records.

The script is designed to analyze financial data, calculate key metrics, display the results on the console, and save the results to a text file for further reference.

Import Libraries:
    import csv: Imports the CSV module for reading and parsing CSV files.
    import os: Imports the OS module for interacting with the operating system.

Define File Path:
file_path: Creates an absolute file path by joining the directory path and the filename. The file path points to a CSV file containing financial data.

Define Analysis Function:
    analyze_financial_records(csvdata): This function takes a CSV file path as an argument and performs the following tasks:
    Initializes variables to store various financial metrics (e.g., total months, net total, profit/loss changes, and dates).
    Opens and reads the CSV file using the csv.reader object.
    Skips the header row using next(csvreader).
    Iterates through each row in the CSV file, extracting date and profit/loss values.
    Calculates total months, net total, and profit/loss changes.
    Updates lists with profit/loss changes and corresponding dates.
    Calculates the average change, greatest increase, and greatest decrease.
    Prints the financial analysis results to the console.
    Calls another function (write_results_to_file) to save the results to a text file.

Write Results to File Function:
    write_results_to_file(file_name, total_months, net_total, average_change, greatest_increase_date, greatest_increase, greatest_decrease_date, greatest_decrease): This function takes a file name and financial metrics as arguments and writes the financial analysis results to a text file.

Call Analysis Function:
    analyze_financial_records(file_path): Calls the analyze_financial_records function with the provided CSV file path to initiate the analysis.

In summary, this script reads financial data from a CSV file, calculates various financial metrics, prints the results to the console, and saves the results to a text file named "financial_results.txt." The goal is to analyze and summarize financial information, providing insights such as total months, net total, average change, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits.
